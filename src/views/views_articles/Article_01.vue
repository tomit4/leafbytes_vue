                    When I decided to dive in deep, and make my best attempt at learning everything I could about
                    Computers, I had already been, what is commonly called, a "Power User" of computers (at least
                    when it came to the Windows Operating System), and so didn't have as tough a time as some would have
                    when I started my journey into learning the intricacies of computer programming. I have been a more
                    than adequate typist since the age of eight years old and had taken the time to learn more
                    than a few keyboard shortcuts. These skills would prove invaluable as they would compound
                    on the skills necessary for basic desktop operations, and eventually, programming.

                    There is such a huge skill and knowledge divide between the average everyday user of today's
                    computers and programmers, and that divide is becoming ever wider with the emphasis placed on
                    tablets, phones, and touchscreens. In many ways, the ability to adequately type is becoming a
                    lost art form that only college graduates are capable of, let alone the amount of those who
                    know about basic keyboard shortcuts These skills, while not uncommon, are also not nearly as
                    common as they should be, especially when considering the prevalance of computers in our lives.
                    This is certainly an opinion (as is nearly everything written on this blog), but I think it
                    goes without saying that the ability to type at least 40 words per minute (WPM) is as important
                    as, if not more important than, the ability to drive a motor vehicle in today's modern world.

                    So where do you get started when learning to code? If you already can type adequately without
                    looking down at your hands, and are familiar with some basic keyboard shortcuts, then honestly
                    you are miles ahead than those who start this journey with absolutely no knowledge of keyboards,
                    let alone computers. But this blog is written by a beginner computer programmer. So come, let
                    the blind lead the blind..., and let's cover some basics.

                    Learning to type adequately and get to the minimum threshold of being able to comfortably type
                    40WPM will take about two months of dedicated practice by my estimation (if you are a complete
                    beginner), practicing at least 2 hours a day. Other than a desktop/laptop computer and a
                    screen, you will(obviously) need a keyboard to get started. You should purchase a keyboard that
                    is comfortable to you, but, ultimately, any modern keyboard will do for the purposes of
                    learning how to type as long as it has the standard QWERTY layout(if the upper left hand row of
                    your keyboard spells out QWERTY, you're good to go).

                    The next resource you'll need is a typing tutorial/course. These can be paid or free, but I'd
                    recommend that you simply go to any of the multitude of free online resources. I personally like

                    At first you will find yourself typing slowly and looking down at the keyboard often. Do not
                    fret, do your best to not get frustrated. Learning a new skill takes time and is rarely a
                    comfortable experience. Whenever you find yourself looking down at the keyboard, return your
                    fingers to the home row, place your index fingers on the j and f keys, feel the raised bars at
                    the bottom of the keys with your fingers to remind yourself of the tactile sensation of being
                    in the proper starting position, and continue to memorize where each key is. Eventually this
                    muscle memory will become engrained in you, and you will be more focused on what you are
                    trying to write, rather than the location of the keys.

                    Once you feel you can write a short essay (2 pages long), at about 40wpm, you are ready to move
                    onto learning some basic keyboard shortcuts. This is markedly easier than learning to type, but
                    provides you with an ability to navigate applications (particularly the web browser and word
                    processor) much faster, and ultimately this makes doing research and editing documents much
                    easier, less frustrating, and faster. Here are some of the basics that exist on the most
                    common desktop platforms:

                    The skill of typing and knowing certain keyboard shortcuts are not necessary, per se, to
                    learning how to code, but having a basic proficiency in typing will make your journey learning
                    to code much easier. An approachable way to think about the learning process when it comes to
                    typing is that it is very much akin to learning how to walk. Using the mouse can be thought of
                    as crawling, typing as walking, and utilizing slightly more advanced tools like keyboard
                    shortcuts and text editors like vim as running. All this said, there is a point of
                    diminishing returns when it comes to the correlation between quality of code and typing speed.
                    At some point you are reading code and looking at code and thinking about code much more than
                    simply typing it. You do not need to have the typing speed of a courtroom stenographer to learn
                    how to code, but it is essential that your typing speed (or lack thereof) not hinder your train
                    of thought when you do put your thoughts onto the screen. The location of the keys must be
                    subconscious in your mind so that the only constraint is the speed of your thoughts, not the
                    speed of fingers.

                    I was once told that learning to code and program was like learning to wield a great lever.
                    Once I had learned the skills to a certain capability, I would be able to do a lot with a
                    single flip of a switch. I believe this to be absolutely true. This makes the importance of
                    learning to type ever the more important. Until communicating with computers is done in a more
                    intuitive and immediate fashion, keyboards will remain one of the most important tools in the
                    modern world, as they are, undoubtedly, the predominant way we interface with computers, and
                    will be for the foreseeable future.
