                        This being my first blog post ever, I suppose it is best to do a brief introduction into who I
                        am and what this is all about. My name is Brian Hayes, I am 39 years old, and am currently in
                        the process of slowly but surely learning more and more about the world of Computers and
                        Computer Science, with a focus on web development and software development with the goal of
                        making a career change as a Web Developer.

                        Prior to this, I have worked as a Barista, a Teacher's Assistant, a Graphic Designer, and a
                        Hotel Concierge. I have a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Illustration from The Art Center College
                        of Design in Pasadena.

                        I have always been what would call a "power user" when it comes to computers, but until about
                        two years ago, if you showed me a line of code, I would have scratched my head in confusion
                        (I still do, albeit not as often).

                        The purpose of this blog is to document my opinion and knowledge on computer-related subjects
                        that have and continue to strike my interest to this day.

                        My earliest memory of interacting with a computer was when I was in the second grade, and
                        seeing a green colored MS-DOS command line open. By following the teacher's instructions, I
                        recall playing very basic games on this computer but being relatively uninterested at the time.

                        Prior to the internet becoming a household name, at around 11 or 12 years of age, I remember my
                        mother investing in a digital typewriter, which had the wonderful feature of being able to
                        write text before printing it, so that one could edit one's typos without having to utilize
                        white out on the page. A few years later the desktop computer would become a necessity in the
                        home, as the internet had finally arrived on the worldwide scene, and changed everything.

                        I quickly became enthralled with the user friendliness of Windows (at this time I believe it
                        was Windows 95). I was heavily active in the early days of internet. I was an avid user of
                        AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, and played text-based role-playing games known as MUDs.

                        Eventually video games would take over the focus of my youth, as JRPGs became a passion of
                        mine that lasted nearly a decade, and certainly consumed my high school years.

                        When I arrived at college, computers played a pivotal role as my major was Illustration (and
                        Animation prior to that). I went to college during an interesting period of change for the
                        academic institutions, as they had only half-way evolved and embraced computer technology.
                        As an Illustration Major, I spent more time mixing paint and copying Renaissance Drawings than
                        I did studying Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator (software which, while greatly improved
                        currently, I still have issues with when compared with traditional mediums). That said, I
                        became familiar with the basics of Photoshop (and a bit of Illustrator) which served my needs
                        for making personal work.

                        When I graduated from college, I had little direction about where to go next. All I knew was
                        that I needed to make money and I did what so many in the creative fields did, I went to work
                        at a cafe, specifically Starbucks. The majority of my life has been working low level minimum
                        wage jobs that have been rewarding in many respects, and many would say I had wasted my time
                        learning the arts because of the lack of lucrative opportunites, but I honestly will never
                        regret it. The skills I have are very valuable to me and if I could do it all over again,
                        knowing what I know now, I still would not change a single moment of it.

                        I lived in Los Angeles for eighteen years; making art, cycling, reading and studying, taking
                        up the sport of handball... I have taken up many interests in my life. Two years ago, I landed
                        a job as a concierge for a small hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. It was about as good a job as
                        I had ever had. I eventually became their full time night auditor, which gave me the time to
                        focus on yet another obsession, and I decided it was time to study something that I knew would
                        probably take the rest of my life and I expect it to. I decided, after literally years of
                        debate, to try my hand at learning how to code, and by extension, learn everything I could
                        about Computers.

                        When I say this decision took years just to make, I mean it. I was avidly involved in the
                        Handball community at this time. Coaching, refereeing, playing two to three times a week and
                        training both physically and mentally for it. I had never played sports as a kid, and so my
                        aim to become as good as I could would probably never end. The choice to walk away and study
                        coding was a hard one. I knew I only studied one thing at a time and that this would be no
                        different. I had been dedicated to the sport of Handball for eight years, but it, like art,
                            was a love that would never become a profession.

                        My best friend and long term roommate at the time had at this point been a professional, self
                        taught, JavaScript developer for four years. He had taught himself how to code, made
                        professional contacts within the field of software development, and had landed a lucrative six
                        figure a year paying job. After he landed this job, he had encouraged me to start to learn
                        JavaScript as well. He handed me the book <a class="article-outside-links" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=eloquent+javascript">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, by Marijn Haverbeke, and after
                        working through about four chapters of exercises, decided it wasn't for me. I got easily
                        frustrated at not understanding the syntax, and decided to simply continue pursuing my
                        beloved sport.

                        Roughly four years later, with my Night Audit Job secure, I decided it was time to give
                        computer programming another chance. I gave up Handball, and began devoting all my waking
                        hours to either learning how to code, learning about Linux, or performing my duties at my
                        job.

                        I have since quit my Night Auditor position and moved to Battle Ground,
                        Washington to be closer to my family.

                        another love, another chapter in my life. This blog is meant to document, at least in some
                        small part, my attempts to wade through the vast subjects of Web Development, Computers,
                        and Computer Science. I invite anyone interested in my meanderings to follow along.
